Items appearing in the following notices.txt are provided for the notification and guidance of the recipient in accordance with the listed license.  In an abundance of caution, the listing may include various dependencies applicable only to development, testing, and evaluation, which may not be included in the distribution and, indeed, may have been deprecated in favor of alternatives.  Accordingly, this listing should not be construed as an admission that the listed component appears in the distribution or in the manner indicated.  Similarly, fulfilling a license�s compliance requirements for a particular form of distribution is not an admission that the software is in fact distributed in that form.  Distributions and packaging vary and not all third party components are relied upon in the same manner or degree.  In addition, some compliance documentation, such as embedded notices files in source code, may be found within the distribution itself rather than below.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
